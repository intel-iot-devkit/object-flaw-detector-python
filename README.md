# Object Flaw Detector

| Details               |                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Target OS:            | Ubuntu* 18.04 LTS |
| Programming Language: | Python* 3.6       |
| Time to complete:     | 30 min            |

This reference implementation is also [available in C++](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/reference-implementation-private/blob/object-flaw-measurement/object-flaw-detector-measurement/README.MD).

## What it does

The object flaw detector application detects the anomalies such as color, crack, and orientation of the object moving on a conveyor belt. Anomalies are marked as defective and saved in the color, crack, orientation folders respectively. Also objects with no defects are saved in no_defect folder.
These anomalies data is sent to InfluxDB* database and is visualized on Grafana*.
This application also measures length and width of the object in millimeters.  

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 18.04
- Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit 2020 R3 Release
- Grafana* v5.3.2 
- InfluxDB* v1.6.2

## Setup

### Install Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit 

Refer to [ Install the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit for Linux*](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/OpenVINO-Install-Linux) for more information on how to install and set up the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit

## How It works

This application takes the input from a video camera or a video file for processing.

![Data Flow Diagram](./docs/images/architectural_diagram.png)

**Orientation defect detection:** Get the frame and change the color space to HSV format. Threshold the image based on the color of the object using [inRange](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d9d/tutorial_py_colorspaces.html) function to create a mask. Perform morphological opening and closing on the mask and find the contours using [findContours](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d4/d73/tutorial_py_contours_begin.html) function. Filter the contours based on the area. Perform [PCA](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d1/dee/tutorial_introduction_to_pca.html) (Principal Component Analysis) on the contours to get the orientation of the object.

![orientation](./docs/images/orientation.jpg)

**Color defect detection:** Threshold the image based on the defective color of the object using  [inRange](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d9d/tutorial_py_colorspaces.html) function. Use the mask obtained from the  [inRange](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d9d/tutorial_py_colorspaces.html) function to find the defective area.

![color](./docs/images/color.jpg)

**Crack detection:** Transform the image from BGR to Grayscale format using [cvtColor](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d9d/tutorial_py_colorspaces.html) function. Blur the image using [blur](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d4/d13/tutorial_py_filtering.html) function to remove the noises. Use the contours found on the blurred image to detect the cracks.

![crack](./docs/images/crack.jpg)

Save the images of defective objects in their respective folders. For example, objects with color defect are saved in **color** folder, objects with cracks are saved in **crack** folder, objects with orientation defect are saved in **orientation** folder and objects with no defect are stored in **no_defect** folder.

## Setup

### Get the code

Steps to clone the reference implementation: (object-flaw-detector-python)

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git
    git clone https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/object-flaw-detector-python.git
    
### Install Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit
Before running the application, install the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit. For details, see [Installing the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit for Linux*](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit/choose-download/free-download-linux)

### Other dependencies
#### InfluxDB*
InfluxDB is a time series database designed to handle high write and query loads. It is an integral component of the TICK stack. InfluxDB is meant to be used as a backing store for any use case involving large amounts of timestamped data, including DevOps monitoring, application metrics, IoT sensor data, and real-time analytics.

#### Grafana*
Grafana is an open-source, general purpose dashboard and graph composer, which runs as a web application. It supports Graphite, InfluxDB, Prometheus, Google Stackdriver, AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Loki, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Testdata, Mixed, OpenTSDB and Elasticsearch as backends. Grafana allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored.

To install the dependencies of the RI, run the below command:
   ```
   cd <path_to_the_object-flaw-detector-python_directory>
   ./setup.sh
   ```
### The Config File

The _resources/config.json_ contains the path to the videos that will be used by the application.
The _config.json_ file is of the form name/value pair, `video: <path/to/video>`   

Example of the _config.json_ file:

```
{

    "inputs": [
	    {
            "video": "videos/video1.mp4"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Which Input video to use

The application works with any input video. Find sample videos for object detection [here](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/sample-videos/).  

For first-use, we recommend using the [bolt-detection](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/sample-videos/blob/master/bolt-detection.mp4) video.The video is automatically downloaded to the `resources/` folder.
For example: <br>
The config.json would be:

```
{

    "inputs": [
	    {
            "video": "sample-videos/bolt-detection.mp4"
        }
    ]
}
```
To use any other video, specify the path in config.json file

### Using the Camera instead of video

Replace the path/to/video in the _resources/config.json_  file with the camera ID, where the ID is taken from the video device (the number X in /dev/videoX).   

On Ubuntu, list all available video devices with the following command:

```
ls /dev/video*
```

For example, if the output of above command is /dev/video0, then config.json would be::

```
{

    "inputs": [
	    {
            "video": "0"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Setup the Environment

Configure the environment to use the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit once per session by running the **source** command on the command line:
```
source /opt/intel/openvino/bin/setupvars.sh
```
__Note__: This command needs to be executed only once in the terminal where the application will be executed. If the terminal is closed, the command needs to be executed again.

## Run the Application

- Change the current directory to the git-cloned application code location on your system:
  
  ```
  cd <path-to-object-flaw-detector-python>/application
  ```

- To see a list of the help options:

  ```
  python3 object_flaw_detector.py --help
  ``` 

- Input source can be a video file or a camera.

    - To save defective images in a specific directory

      ```
      python3 object_flaw_detector.py -dir <path_to_the_directory_to_dump_defective_images>
      ```

    - To save defective images in current working directory

      ```
      python3 object_flaw_detector.py
      ```

    **Optional:** If field of view and distance between the object and camera are available use ```-fv```  and ```-dis``` command line arguments respectively. Otherwise camera of 96 pixels per inch is considered by default. For example:

      python3 object_flaw_detector.py -f 60 -d 50

     **Note:** User can get field of view from camera specifications. The values for ```-f``` and ```-d``` should be in __degrees__ and __millimeters__ respectively.

```
influx
show databases
use obj_flaw_database
